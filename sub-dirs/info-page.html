            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Aryabhatta (476 - 550 CE) was the first of the major mathematician-astronomers from the classical age of Indian 
                mathematics and Indian astronomy. His works include the Āryabhaṭīya (which mentions that in 3600 Kali Yuga, 499 CE,
                he was 23 years old) and the Arya-siddhanta.
                <br><br>
                For his explicit mention of the relativity of motion, he also qualifies as a major early physicist.[8]
                <br><br>
                Aryabhatta mentions in the Aryabhatiya that it was composed 3,600 years into the Kali Yuga, when he was 23 years old.
                 This corresponds to 499 CE, and implies that he was born in 476.
                <br><br>
                He died at the age of 74 after a long and fruitful career as mathematics, astronomer, and scientist. When and where
                 he died are still unknown. In Kusumapura, Pataliputra, it was thought that he spent most of his time.

        <h1>Education</h1>
            <p>His upper-level study may have taken place in Kusumapura, and he may have resided in the region for quite some time, 
                according to historical sources from the period. In fact, there has been some conjecture that the place known as 
                Kusumapura might, in fact, be Pataliputra, which was the site of an important astronomical observatory.
                He traveled to Kusumapura for higher studies at some point and that he stayed there for a period of time. Bhaskara I
                (CE 629), a Hindu and Buddhist tradition, as well as historical records, all identify Kusumapura as Paaliputra, the 
                contemporary city of Patna. Poemists have speculated that the university of Nalanda, situated in Pataliputra at the 
                time, possessed an astronomical observatory, which suggests that Aryabhatta was also in charge of the university of
                Nalanda. Aryabhatta is also credited withestablishing an observatory at the Sun Temple in Taregana, Bihar, which is
                still in use today.

        <h1>Contribution in Mathematics</h1>
                <h3>Place value system and zero</h3>
            <p>The place-value system, first seen in the 3rd-century Bakhshali Manuscript, was clearly in place in his work.
                While he did not use a symbol for zero, the French mathematician Georges Ifrah argues that knowledge of zero 
                was implicit in Aryabhata's place-value system as a place holder for the powers of ten with null coefficients.</p>
                
                <h3>Approximation of π</h3>
            <p>Aryabhata worked on the approximation for pi (π), and may have come to the conclusion that π is irrational. 
                It is speculated that Aryabhata used the word āsanna (approaching), to mean that not only is this an approximation
                 but that the value is incommensurable (or irrational). If this is correct, it is quite a sophisticated insight, 
                 because the irrationality of pi (π) was proved in Europe only in 1761 by Lambert.</p>
                
                <h3>Trigonometry</h3>
                <p>In Ganitapada 6, Aryabhata gives the area of a triangle as 
                 tribhujasya phalaśarīraṃ samadalakoṭī bhujārdhasaṃvargaḥ
                that translates to: "for a triangle, the result of a perpendicular with the half-side is the area."
                Aryabhata discussed the concept of sine in his work by the name of ardha-jya, which literally means "half-chord".
                In the 12th century, when Gherardo of Cremona translated these writings from Arabic into Latin, he replaced the 
                Arabic jaib with its Latin counterpart, sinus, which means "cove" or "bay"; thence comes the English word sine.
            </p>
                <h3>Indeterminate equations</h3>
            <p>A problem of great interest to Indian mathematicians since ancient times has been to find integer solutions
                to Diophantine equations that have the form ax + by = c
                Aryabhata's method of solving such problems, elaborated by Bhaskara in 621 CE, is called the kuṭṭaka (कुट्टक) method.
                Kuṭṭaka means "pulverizing" or "breaking into small pieces", and the method involves a recursive algorithm for 
                writing the original factors in smaller numbers. This algorithm became the standard method for solving first-order 
                diophantine equations in Indian mathematics, and initially the whole subject of algebra was called kuṭṭaka-gaṇita 
                or simply kuṭṭaka.</p>
                
                
                <h3>Algebra</h3>
                <p>In Aryabhatiya, Aryabhata provided elegant results for the summation of series of squares and cubes:

        <h1>Contribution in Astronomy</h1>
            <p>Aryabhata's system of astronomy was called the audAyaka system, in which days are reckoned from uday,
                dawn at lanka or "equator". In some texts, he seems to ascribe the apparent motions of the heavens 
                to the Earth's rotation. He may have believed that the planet's orbits as elliptical rather than circular. 
                </p>
                <h3>Motions of the Solar System</h3>
                <p>Aryabhata correctly insisted that the Earth rotates about its axis daily, and that the apparent movement
                    of the stars is a relative motion caused by the rotation of the Earth, contrary to the then-prevailing 
                    view, that the sky rotated. This is indicated in the first chapter of the Aryabhatiya, where he gives 
                    the number of rotations of the Earth in a yuga, and made more explicit in his gola chapter:
                    Aryabhata described a geocentric model of the Solar System, in which the Sun and Moon are each carried by 
                    epicycles. They in turn revolve around the Earth. In this model, which is also found in the Paitāmahasiddhānta
                    (c. 425 CE), the motions of the planets are each governed by two epicycles, a smaller manda (slow) and 
                    a larger śīghra (fast). The order of the planets in terms of distance from earth is taken as: the Moon,
                    Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and the asterisms.
                    The positions and periods of the planets was calculated relative to uniformly moving points. In the case
                    of Mercury and Venus, they move around the Earth at the same mean speed as the Sun. In the case of Mars,
                    Jupiter, and Saturn, they move around the Earth at specific speeds, representing each planet's motion 
                    through the zodiac.</p> 
                <h3>Eclipses</h3>
                <p>Solar and lunar eclipses were scientifically explained by Aryabhata. He states that the Moon and planets 
                    shine by reflected sunlight. Instead of the prevailing cosmogony in which eclipses were caused by Rahu 
                    and Ketu (identified as the pseudo-planetary lunar nodes), he explains eclipses in terms of shadows cast
                    by and falling on Earth. Thus, the lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon enters into the Earth's shadow 
                    (verse gola.37). He discusses at length the size and extent of the Earth's shadow and then provides the 
                    computation and the size of the eclipsed part during an eclipse. Later Indian 
                    astronomers improved on the calculations, but Aryabhata's methods provided the core.</p>
                
                <h3>Sidereal periods</h3>
                <p>Aryabhata's work was of great influence in the Indian astronomical tradition and influenced several 
                    neighbouring cultures through translations. The Arabic translation during the Islamic Golden Age 
                    (c. 820 CE), was particularly influential. Some of his results are cited by Al-Khwarizmi and in the 
                    10th century Al-Biruni stated that Aryabhata's followers believed that the Earth rotated on its axis.
                    His definitions of sine (jya), cosine (kojya), versine (utkrama-jya), and inverse sine (otkram jya) 
                    influenced the birth of trigonometry. He was also the first to specify sine and versine (1 - cos x) tables, 
                    in 3.75° intervals from 0° to 90°, to an accuracy of 4 decimal places.
